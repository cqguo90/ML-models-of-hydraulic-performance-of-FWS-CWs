# ML-models-of-hydraulic-performance-of-FWS-CWs
There are some ML algorithms for quantitative prediciton of hydraulic performance of FWS CWs based on several design parameters.
As we all known, the hdyraulic performance of free water surface constructed wetlands (FWS CWs) is seriously affected by the design parameters. Optimizing the combinatiion of design parameters of FWS CWs could considerably improve the hydraulic performance, and further improve the purification efficiency of wastewater contaminants.
