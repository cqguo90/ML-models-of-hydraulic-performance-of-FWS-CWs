# ML-models-of-hydraulic-performance-of-FWS-CWs
There are some ML algorithms for quantitative prediciton of hydraulic performance of FWS CWs based on several design parameters.

As we all known, the hdyraulic performance of free water surface constructed wetlands (FWS CWs) is seriously affected by the design parameters. Optimizing the combinatiion of design parameters of FWS CWs could considerably improve the hydraulic performance, and further improve the purification efficiency of wastewater contaminants.

Here, based on the limited field test data, a numerical model of hydrodynamics of FWS CWs was constructed (EFDC). Based on a large number of numerical simulations of the EFDC model, three large-sample datasets are generated, namely, training set, test set, and extension set. Based on these large-sample datasets, we trained, tested, and evaluated the fitting, prediction, and generalziation abilities of different ML models. 

In order to keep the authors working, we only put a few index values in different data files so that the model can run. Similarly, only one ML model is put in here to demonstrate the processing flow, and the other ML models are processed similarly. The model training precedure used to obtain the hyperparameters is omitted here.
